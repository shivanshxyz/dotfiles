    <p class="guide-para"><strong>FrontEnd50</strong> is a tool that’ll help you kickstart your web development journey. It is a curation of articles,videos and tools that’ll make learning fun, easy and well-structured.</p>

    <p class="guide-para">There are a few things you should follow to get maximum value out of the time you invest in learning things as a beginner in the world of web development.</p>

    <h2 class="guide-sub-header">1. 80% Practice – 20% Theory</h2>
    <p class="guide-para">While you need to follow learning guides and tutorials to understand topics, the best way to retain all the coding concepts is by practicing them over and over again. REPETITION IS THE KEY!</p>
    <p class="guide-para">It’s just like learning regular languages, you can’t learn Spanish just by reading articles that explain Spanish grammar. You’ll have to form a habit of speaking/writing the language to actually learn it.</p>

    <h2 class="guide-sub-header">2. Nail Your Fundamentals</h2>
    <p class="guide-para">Much of your web development journey will depend on how well you grasp your fundamentals. Almost all the concepts in web development branch out from the basics. </p>
    <p class="guide-para">If you are facing a difficulty with a concept, invest more time in learning it before moving ahead. This will ensure that you don’t have to keep going back to revisit concepts and your progress will remain steady in the long run. </p>

    <h2 class="guide-sub-header">3. Trust The Process</h2>
    <p class="guide-para">The course does not omit any important concepts, it covers everything you need to understand the core of front end development. It is designed to make you highly functional with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and provide you with a strong base to kickstart
        your web development journey. </p>


    <h2 class="guide-sub-header">4. Projects Will Transform Your Knowledge</h2>
    <p class="guide-para">If you ever feel underconfident or lose motivation, wait till you reach the next project. There are 11 projects in this 50 day challenge. Projects will bring all the bits and pieces together to show you the larger picture. Each project will increase
        your ability to create interesting things and also make you more comfortable with the topics that you learn.</p>

    <h2 class="guide-sub-header">Post Your Work on Twitter/Write Articles on Medium</h2>
    <p class="guide-para">Take up a challenge like #100DaysofCode or post articles on Medium talking about your web development journey. The tech community is highly-active on social media and is always willing to guide/provide advice to newbies. </p>
    <p class="guide-para">Also, it helps to document your overall progress and get noticed by prospective employers who might be able to get a glimpse of your work and ability to express yourself through your posts and articles.</p>

    <p class="guide-para">Now that these things are out of the way, go ahead and begin your web development journey, and don’t forget to <strong>CREATE SOMETHING GREAT.</strong></p>
